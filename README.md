# Ray Tracer Implementation Progress

## Current Implementation Status

We have implemented a basic ray tracer that can:
1. Generate images in both PPM and PNG formats
2. Create a blue-to-white gradient background
3. Render a red sphere at position (0,0,-1) with radius 0.5

## Key Components Implemented

### Vector and Color Classes
- `vec3.h`: 3D vector class with basic operations
- `color.h`: Color type alias and color writing utilities

### Ray Class
- `ray.h`: Ray representation with origin and direction
- Ray-sphere intersection testing

### Image Generation
- PPM format output
- PNG format conversion utility
- Progress indicator during rendering

### Camera Setup
- Viewport configuration
- Ray generation for each pixel
- Aspect ratio handling (16:9)

## Current Features
- 400x225 pixel output (maintaining 16:9 aspect ratio)
- Blue-to-white gradient background
- Red sphere rendering
- Progress logging during rendering
- Dual output format support (PPM and PNG)

## Next Steps
1. Improve sphere intersection calculations
2. Add surface normals for better shading
3. Implement multiple objects
4. Add lighting and materials
5. Implement shadows and reflections

## Build Instructions
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
./raytracer > image.ppm
./ppm2png image.ppm image.png
```

## Dependencies
- C++17
- CMake
- stb_image_write (included in third_party/)
